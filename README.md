### Junior Software Developer (1-3 years)

#### **Git:**
   - What is Git and what are its key features?
> **Answer:** Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to source code over time. Its key features include branching, merging, and remote collaboration.

   - How do you perform a merge and resolve conflicts?
> **Answer:** You can merge branches in Git using the `git merge` command. If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually.

For example:

     ```bash
     git merge feature-branch
     ```

#### **HTML & CSS:**
   - What is the difference between inline, internal, and external CSS?
> **Answer:** Inline CSS is applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute. Internal CSS is defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. External CSS is defined in a separate `.css` file and linked to an HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

   - Explain the concept of CSS box model.
> **Answer:** The CSS box model consists of content, padding, border, and margin. The content area is where the text and images are placed. Padding is the space between the content and the border. Border is the line that surrounds the padding and content. Margin is the space outside the border.

#### **SCSS:**
   - What is SCSS and how does it differ from CSS?
> **Answer:** SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It adds features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions, which make CSS more maintainable and scalable.

   - How do you use variables in SCSS?
> **Answer:** You can define variables using the `$` symbol in SCSS.

For example:

     ```scss
     $primary-color: #3498db;
     $font-size: 16px;

     body {
       color: $primary-color;
       font-size: $font-size;
     }
     ```

#### **JSON:**
   - What is JSON and how is it used in web development?
> **Answer:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used in web development to send data from a server to a client or vice versa.

   - How do you parse JSON data in JavaScript?
> **Answer:** You can parse JSON data using the `JSON.parse()` method in JavaScript.
For example:

     ```javascript
     const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
     const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
     console.log(obj.name); // Output: John
     ```

#### **JavaScript Basics:**
   - What is an event loop in JavaScript?
> **Answer:** An event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations. It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations, such as reading from a file or making a network request, without blocking the execution of the main thread.

   - Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript.
> **Answer:** Synchronous code is executed sequentially, meaning that each line must complete before the next line is executed. Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows certain tasks to run in the background without blocking the main execution thread.

#### **React:**
   - What is the purpose of React and why is it popular?
> **Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It is popular because it allows developers to build complex UIs in a declarative and efficient way.

   - How do you handle state in a functional component using hooks?
> **Answer:** You can use the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.

For example:

     ```jsx
     import React, { useState } from 'react';

     function Counter() {
       const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

       return (
         <div>
           <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
           <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
             Click me
           </button>
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

#### **Decoupled Drupal:**
   - What is decoupled Drupal, and why would you use it?

          -moz-border-radius: $radius;
           -ms-border-radius: $radius;
               border-radius: $radius;
     }

     @function multiply($a, $b) {
       @return $a * $b;
     }

     .box {
       @include border-radius(10px);
       width: multiply(5, 10);
     }
     ```

#### **JSON:**
   - How do you handle nested JSON data in JavaScript?
> **Answer:** You can handle nested JSON data by recursively accessing the properties. For example:

     ```javascript
     const jsonData = {
       "user": {
         "name": "John",
         "age": 30,
         "address": {
           "city": "New York",
           "zip": "10001"

#### **JavaScript Advanced:**
   - What is the difference between call, apply, and bind?
> **Answer:** `call`, `apply`, and `bind` are methods that allow you to set the `this` context for a function. `call` takes arguments as individual parameters, `apply` takes them as an array, and `bind` returns a new function with the specified `this` context.

   - Explain how closures work in JavaScript.
> **Answer:** A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer functionâ€™s scope, and the global scope. Closures allow you to maintain state between function calls.

#### **React:**
   - How do you handle side effects in React components?
> **Answer:** You can handle side effects using the `useEffect` hook in functional components. For example:
     ```jsx
     import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

     function MyComponent() {
       useEffect(() => {
         console.log('Component did mount or update');
         return () => {
           console.log('Component will unmount');
         };
       }, [dependency]);

       return <div>My Component</div>;
     }
     ```

   - What is the purpose of higher-order components (HOCs)?
> **Answer:** HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. They are used to share functionality between components without duplicating code.

#### **Decoupled Drupal:**
   - How do you handle authentication and state management in a decoupled Drupal setup?
> **Answer:** You can handle authentication by using Drupal's RESTful API or a token-based system. For state management, you can use a state management library like Redux in your React app.

   - What are the benefits of using RESTful APIs in a decoupled architecture?
